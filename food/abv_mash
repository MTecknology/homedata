To determine how much alcohol is in your mash, you subtract your final SG from your starting SG and divide by 7.5
Ex. Starting SG 1.080
Final SG 1.000
____________________
80 divided by 7.5= 10.6%

Another way is to multiply the difference by 131.25
Ex. .080 X 131.25= 10.5
Not sure which way is more accurate, for my purposes, it's close enough.
