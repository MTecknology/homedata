BBQ Seasoning
=============

Note: I have not yet tried this recipe or found proportions.

- cinammon
- cocoa (very tiny amount)
- toast brown sugar then food processor
- celery salt
- celery powder

Best wood for smoking: oak, hickory, cherry

Brisket should be able to stretch but pull apart; cut pencil thick


roast prime rib over fresh veggies (moisture)
