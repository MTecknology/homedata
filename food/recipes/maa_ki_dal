MTeck's Maa Ki Dal
==================

Inspired by an Indian friend, I mashed together my favorite of a few recipes and came up with this stuff.

Ingretients:
```
1 C	Black Urad Dal
1/2 C	Kidney Beans
1/4 C	Bengal Gram
--
2 Tbsp	Ghee
2	Bay Leafs
1 tsp	Kasuri Methi
1 tsp	Kala Jeera
1	Sweet Onion (finely chopped)
1	Serrano Pepper (split, de-seeded)
1 Tbsp	Garlic Paste
1 Tbsp	Ginger Paste
1 tsp	Red Chilli Powder
2 tsp	Garam Masala Powder
1/2 tsp	Coriander Powder
1/4 tsp	Cumin Powder
1 tsp	Salt
4	Small (Vine Ripened) Tomatoes (finely chopped)
```

Instructions:
```
Soak legumes in water
- at least 4x volume of beans
- 4-6 hours; do not exceed 12 hr
Drain & Rinse
Add legumes and 4 C. water to pressure cooker
Cook on high for 25 minutes
When cooled, lightly mash legumes
- should squish very easily

In pan:
Bring ghee to temp
Add bay leaf, kala jeera, kasuri methi
Saute until it becomes aromatic or kala jeera starts crackling
Add onion and peppers
Saute until onions are well-cooked (soft)
Add garlic paste, ginger paste
Saute until golden brown
Add chilli powder, garam masala powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, salt
Saute until it becomes aromatic (will become paste-like)

Cook until tomatoes are broken down (soft & mushy)

Add legumes (retaining water)
Add 1 C water (for lighter consistency)
Cook 10 min
Cook on medium for 45 minutes
```
