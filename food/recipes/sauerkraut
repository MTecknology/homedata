Sauerkraut

First Attempt
-------------

Unfortunately, this recipe was lost.
It was flavorful and tasty. :(

Second Attempt
--------------

8.6 lb red/green cabbage (73%)
3.2 lb fennel bulbs (27%)

((8.6 + 3.2) * 453.592) * 0.015 = 80.3
80.3 grams himalayan pink salt (finely ground)

[ per ~10 lb (coarsely ground)]
1 Tbsp juniper berries
2 Tbsp caraway seeds
2 tsp aniseed
2 tsp celery seeds

Mix salt and seasonings

Finely slice cabbage/fennel
Create layers of salt and sliced cabbage
Press down firmly
Let rest for at least 30 minutes
  ^ good time to clean
Punch 'n mash the cabbage/salt mixture
Ensure cabbage is submerged below brine

Wait 3+ weeks (active CO2 for the first 3-5 days)
Check occasionally to ensure brine is above cabbage
  ^ a 5 gallon bucket, typical dinner plate, and weight are excellent for this

Results
+++++++

It's definitely not as good as the first attempt, but still very good.
It needs more fennel and some black pepper.
