Bone Broth/Stock
================

The old recipe was lost so this was a bit ad-lib... and this recipe was also
a bit of a mess. It started as a nicely documented list, but then got broken
from two 6 qt slow cooker to an additional 8 qt slow cooker.

Starting recipe
--------------

This was supposed to be for a 6 qt slow cooker.
Initially, two were used, so ingredients doubled.

1/2 fennel top (bulb excluded)
1/2 bunch parsley stems
  - Should have been cilantro, but they were mislabeled at the store
3 celery stalks
3 bay leaves
4 carrots
3 dried star anise
2 large red potatoes
1 orange bell pepper
1 tsp whole tri-color peppercorn
3 cloves lightly crushed garlic
2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar
  - wine vinegar /might/ work better

one large bone, or a few smaller rib bones
  - make sure they have a good amount of marrow
  - Renner Corner has smoked cattle femurs
    + Meant for dogs, suitable for human
    + Absolutely delicious smoke!!

Modification
------------

The three bones purchased would not fit inside two 6 qt slow cookers and an
additional 8 qt slow cooker needed to be purchased. The larger bone was still
unable to fit into the 8 qt pot and needed to be cut into two pieces.

Since the recipe needed to be divided, everything that wasn't a bone was put
into a large bowl, [more veggies] were added, the were mixed, and then evenly
divided.

[more veggies]:
- 4 large red potatoes
- 1 fennel top (bulb excluded)
- 4 celery stalks
- 3 dried star anise
- 3 bay leaves
2 Tbsp vinegar

Preparation
-----------

Pre-heat oven to 450 F.
Roast bones for at least 45 minutes.

Put bones into slow cookers.
Add the veggies.
Fill up with purified water.

Cook on low 70-80 hours.
Ideally, bones should get to the point that a fork can poke through them.

Strain through sieve.
Straight again through sieve lined with cheesecloth.

Preservation
------------

In a refrigerator, this will only last 3-5 days.
If frozen, it can last about six months.
