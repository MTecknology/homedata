Inalert is a private project I once worked on that needed to quickly send
out notifications to subscribers when certain messages were received. This
was used to provide an ad-hoc alert system.

This project additionally collected and aggregated the log data and
provided an option for users to run queries. This was done using an
ELK stack with some extremely painful regular expressions. I actually
reached the limits of what Logstash can handle and had to break it into
three different groups of regular expressions.
