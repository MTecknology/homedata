This script is used by the jabberd2-c2s process to verify user credentials
against an custom internal application.

This was refactored because the old version was not able to handle the full
load from production, could not cache credentials, and was very slow. It was
rewritten to run more like a daemon than a script. Caching was originally
built into the single-threaded process but later transitioned to redis which
added support for shared cache between redundant systems and removed cache
rebuild time during application startup.
