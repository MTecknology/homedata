100 Bytes
=========

This was a fun little brain-teaser presented to me by someone during their own
application screening process. After thinking about it for a little bit, I
started to realize what great challenge it is. With a few extra details and a
few left out, the developer is forced to work within "real world" constraints
and handle assumptions and unknowns. Having to read backward adds an
interesting challenge, as does working efficiently with the creation of many
files.

Requirements
------------

As Quoted::

    Incorporate:

    - creativity
    - Modules used
    - Efficiency of the code during runtime.

    Scan a 10M log file, and create chunks of files of 100 chars lines in each
    chunks, from the 10M log file. 100th character can be end of a word or a
    space. If itâ€™s a broken word, add it to next file.

No additional details are provided.
