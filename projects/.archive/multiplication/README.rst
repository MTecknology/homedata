Multiplication Table
====================

This was a quick code question I was asked once upon a time. They said I
wouldn't be able to use bash because it's not capable and that formatting
doesn't matter. Of course, I took both of those statements as a challenge.

The default shows 1*1 through 9*9, but an extra argument can be passed to
change the upper limit.
