dev:
    Hi, I would like to know where are the log files saved in the server for
    [server name], [server name] and also want see the hosting files. Hope you
    have some info about it, Please let me know.

admin:
    Are you just looking for the web server access logs?

dev:
    Kind off and hosting files.

admin:
    I’m not quite sure what you mean by hosting files. What kind of data are
    you looking for in these files?

dev:
    Do you know about server logs.. I can make it work..

dev:
    I just want to know about webserver logs ..

admin:
    Yes I do know about the server logs. I was just curious what kind of data
    you were looking for so I could provide access accordingly. Here is a
    sample of the nginx access.log file. Is this what you are looking for?
    [examples from nginx access.log provided]

dev:
    Do you know any PHP logs saved in the server  for [server name]?

admin:
    uwsgi is the package that handles PHP for the web server (Nginx). Here is
    what the logs for that look like: [sample logs from uwsgi provided]. Are
    either of these what you are looking for?

dev:
    How can I access them?

admin:
    I need you to actually answer my questions so I know what you are looking for.

dev:
    They should look like this one attached. When I change or update anything in
    the code the server will automatically  create this logs.

admin:
    I found this log that was written to today that looks like it contains the
    same type of information as the log file that you sent as an example. Does
    this look like what are needing?

dev:
    These are the ones I am looking.. Can I have access..

admin:
    I’ll get you an account to log into [server name] and [server name] over
    SSH. Do you need access to both “app.log” and the nginx web server access log?

dev:
    That would be great. Can we do that today ..

admin:
    Yes. I’ll get you the access in the next hour


notes:
    * dev tried to update admin password by pasting an unknown password hash
      into the terminal window (the hash was the command.. that's it) 
    * dev attempted this in varying ways before giving up and trying http updates
