My first tattoo is a cross on my left pectoral muscle. I got it to celebrate
turning old enough to get one ... silly reason, but a good choice given the
motivation. :)

My second tattoo is a panther in front of a moon on my right shoulder. I like
this except that they didn't actually make the face look more like a "man in the
moon" than a "skull." I might get that fixed ... someday.

My third tattoo is three dots that were used to align the machine during
radiation therapy, between chemo and getting a permanent ostomy.

This design for my fourth tattoo is to celebrate sobriety and all of the other
things that have contributed to the improvement of my life, including my
introduction into open source software.

A random pile of thoughts on meaning for this fourth tattoo::

    06:59 < MTecknology> The basic idea is from the AA logo -
          https://kclr96fm.com/media/2017/11/aalogo.jpg, because I want to remind myself
          that I'm incapable of long-term moderation when I start drinking. The circle
          is just a celtic-style circle and the triangle is just a penrose triangle.
    07:04 < MTecknology> The three dots can mean 4 things. 1) words from the AA logo
          2) three dots I have from radiation therapy 3) "mi vida loca" ("my crazy life"
          usually a prison tat associated w/ and gang life) 4) christian tat meaning
          "the whole of the universe" (time, human, & world; usually in a row).
